# SystemC_Cooley-Tukey_fft
SystemC hardware description of a 8-points FFT using Cooley-Tukey algorithm during academic lessons.

This is a FFT using Cooley-Tukey algorithm, coding with a HLS language, SystemC. The SystemC package is needed if you want to compile it, but you can see the result with the software GTKwave.
